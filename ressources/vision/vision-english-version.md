How facilitation helps to achieve a shared vision

## What is vision?

In general, vision answers the question Why?
The most common use is for the product (called Product Vision).

*The vision can also be extended to the team, the one in charge of the product to be made. The question of Why (why do we exist as a team?) helps to forge a team spirit prior to working on the product. This issue will be addressed in the Rules theme*.

The vision (product) is first expressed by the sponsor or client. It can be reformulated collectively, and then the team responds by stating its mission. To ensure that the mission is on track, season objectives are defined with expected key results.

This is why the theme has 3 components: vision, mission and season (with objectives defined by expected key results).

For each component of the vision we give a list of questions that facilitation can help answer.

### Definitions
- The vision (product), driven by the sponsor, expresses the desired futur of the users of the product or service.
- The mission, defined by the team, expresses what they plan to do to achieve the vision.
- The season is the period over which the mission is broken down into objectives.

### Links with other themes

Rules add context to the vision. The definition of the vision involves collective decision-making. A shared vision helps to avoid conflicts during an activity. Decisions are made with the team's mission in mind.

## Vision
*Product Vision*

The sponsor is the person who decides to grant the budget, assign people and give resources to the team. He/she gives his/her vision of the product or service to be developed by the team. He/she is usually the one who receives the revenue from the team's results.

Questions addressed:
- Who is the sponsor? Who are the other stakeholders?
- Why does our team exist?
- What will our product do?
- How will this product change users' lives? What problem does it solve?

## Mission

Team Mission

The mission is what the team proposes to do to achieve the vision. The vision clarifies the why, the mission sets out, without the details, what the team proposes to do to move towards the vision. It gives just enough information to allow the team to focus on a medium or long term horizon.

Questions addressed:
- How will we make the vision a reality?
- Who are the users?
- What (high-level) solution do we envisage?
- What value does it bring to them?

## Season

corresponds to the notion of Mission tests_.

The vision and mission are notions that set a course. To know if the team will follow the right direction, it gives itself tests, in the form of quantitative key impacts. This will make it possible to evaluate the path taken in order to change the direction to follow if necessary. The proposed timeframe is the season, therefor 3 months.

Questions addressed:
- How do we know if we are making good progress towards our mission?
- What are the expected key impacts for the coming season?
- How can we collect measures to evaluate the key impacts?

## Project Charter

*Project Charter

The team summarises, in a very short document, ideally one that can be displayed on the walls of the workspace or in a space on Miro, the components that enable agreement on the shared vision with the sponsor and stakeholders.

This constitutes the project charter.

Questions addressed:
- How to make this vision visible?
- How to adhere to this shared vision and make it live?

The charter can be extended to include values and rules, to form the team's raison d'Ãªtre, and be presented in an outline:

## An example: PermaBio

### Vision

#### Poster

PermaBio poster](/faci-disc/assets/poster.jpg)

#### Vision Draft
*Formulated by the sponsor

Born from the observation that people wanted to eat good local products, PermaBio aims to become a local platform for the exchange of organic fruit and vegetables.
The principle is not to keep stocks, the fruit and vegetables are harvested on demand. Of course, this means that only seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in permaculture by a network of gardeners are offered.

### Mission

#### Users

- Elodie: PermaBio user for cooking
- Bob: gardener

At PermaBio
- Marie: vegetable supplier
- Victor: sales representative
- Pierre: sponsor

#### Use value
- Elodie makes soups for her children with beautiful vegetables
- Bob sells his tomatoes

#### Other values
- Income for the sponsor: users pay for the vegetables
- Ecological value: reduced carbon impact with bike deliveries, less waste with composting
- Social value: sharing of surplus

#### Product qualities

- commitment to deliver in less than an hour from order and only by bike
- connection with cooking websites (such as mesrecettes.com) to add a "have PermaBio deliver to you" button below the recipe ingredient list
- mobile app

#### Mission Draft

*Formulated by the team

PermaBio provides the ingredients and recipe for cooking at home. The price is per portion: no need to weigh each vegetable or to have a price per kilo. The price of the share decreases with the number requested.

Deliveries are only made by bicycle, which limits the radius to 10 km. The commitment is to deliver within one hour of the order being placed.

The proposals are based on what is available in the PermaBio field or at one of the certified gardeners. What is offered is therefore updated to take into account the fruits and vegetables that can be harvested. PermaBio offers a soup, a starter, a vegetable dish and a dessert with fruit.
These dishes are changed every day. PermaBio provides all the ingredients for cooking, including the spices in the recipe.

### Season

The objectives for season 1, defined by the team, include 5 key impacts:

## The importance of facilitation

Facilitation helps to ensure that the vision is truly **shared** and permeates the life of the team.
It therefore encourages the sponsor to formulate its initial vision and the team to respond to it by developing its own mission. Sharing the vision and mission leads to consensus through exchange.
This facilitation usually requires two loops of exchange: the first may take place before the team is fully formed, the second includes the whole team.

The effective sharing of the vision is based on a social contract developed with the project charter.

Facilitating a shared vision also means taking care that the vision and the mission do not remain distant objectives disconnected from reality and ultimately forgotten.
This is why the implementation of the mission over the coming season is the fundamental link between strategy and tactics.
This implies that the shared vision should be re-facilitated regularly - every season - in order to define the objectives for the new season and, if necessary, to revise the mission, or even the vision.

## The workshop

the workshop is divided into 5 parts :
1. the subject (15')
2. vision (45')
3. mission (30')
4. season (30')
5. consolidating the charter (15')

## Peetic
# h1
# 1. Peetic/Shelter
- The idea: Peetic is a dating platform for animals (and their masters) Emma (or Mat), who is a sponsor, wants Peetic to become the reference platform for the adoption of animals in shelters. Here's what she/he says:

*There are 100,000 abandoned animals per year in France. With the pandemic, this figure has figure has increased and the associations lack the capacity to take in everyone.
I would like Peetic to become the platform to help shelters to have their animals adopted. Our goal is not to make money but to be recognised.

- A little solution: We already have dog and cat characteristics sheets. We will provide an interface for shelters to describe their animals.
We will add adoption functionality by allowing foster families to get in touch with the shelters and work their way through the adoption process.

- Roles for the workshop:
    - **sponsor**
    - **Refuge Director**: would like the animals to stay less time in her shelter (currently one and a half months)
    - **Developer**: Concerned about animal welfare, he/she encourages the team to be sure the adoption is responsible, including sterilisation of the animal and involvement of the
foster family.
    - **Product Owner**: suggests that the first focus should be on cats, the vast majority of animals in shelters.
    - **A foster family**
    
## Vision
The sponsor presents his/her product idea 

### Individual reflection (7')
This part is done in silence. 
Each participant tries to answer the question:
> What does our product do?

They write each of their answers on a post-it.

Note** >
> Everyone is invited to put themselves in the shoes of the role they are playing to give their answers.

### Grouping by affinity (7')
Everyone sticks their post-its. The facilitator asks the participants to group them (3 to 7 groups), and to give a name to each group. Discussion is encouraged.

### Draft vision statement (7')
The names of the groups are the basis for writing the first vision statement.
The person playing the role of PO writes it and places it in the box on the canvas provided for this purpose. Everyone helps him/her; in case of disagreement, the sponsor decides.

### Product poster (24')
The workshop is a variation on the product box (the products in question have not been presented in boxes for a long time!), an old and widespread marketing practice, which can be found in the book Innovation Games.

#### Part 1: the poster (20')

The facilitator asks the group to make a poster informing users that the application they are dreaming of is available. The facilitator then leaves it up to the participants to design the poster. To orientate them, the facilitator announces that, after having made the poster, they will have to use it to sell the idea to the other groups.

> Note**
> Optionally, provide magazines, scissors and glue for participants to use to decorate their poster.

The poster is a good way to get suggestions for logos or slogans, relying on the skills of the participants. The group can then express themselves through drawings, colours or collages to represent the ideal product they imagine.

The facilitator should ensure that there is also text, a simple and attractive message, to encourage people to become users of the product. It is advisable to warn the group a little before the end, to encourage them to prepare collectively to present their poster.

#### Second part: presentation (4')

The 2 groups of 2 facilitators present to each other.
Each group presents its poster and answers questions from the other participants.

> **Note**
> All the posters (from the 8 groups) are then stuck on a wall.

## Mission

The information on the **poster** is usually also useful for defining the mission, which is done in 4 sequences, for which the participants are divided into pairs.

### Users (3')
Identification of users (primary, secondary).

### Benefit to users (7')

For each type of user, the pair identifies the value (of use) that the product brings them.

### Other benefits (5')

What the service brings to the sponsor (income), the ecological value, the social value.

### Product qualities (5')

The qualities and characteristics deduced from the proposed solution.

### Draft mission statement (10')

The post-it notes of the pairs are placed in the 4 zones (users, use value, other benefits, qualities).
The group groups them by affinity in each zone.
Based on the users and the value they receive, formulate a first version of the mission with action verbs.

Add the results of the other two zones.

Place the text thus developed in the box dedicated to the mission on the canvas.

## Season

The season lasts 3 months.

### Remembering the impacts (18')

Workshop adapted from **Remembering/back the Future**, one of the _Innovation Games_.

Participants are asked to teleport themselves to the future, four months from now. During the last month, they used the application that was deployed at the end of the season on a daily basis. 

> **Warning**
> It's a workshop that works well if you present the going back in time from the future correctly.

Going back in time to the past month, the participants are asked to give the impacts that the application has had on their lives, what has changed their behaviour. This can be based on the benefits identified for the mission.

An impact should be measurable, the facilitators insist on quantitative data.

### Key impacts (12')

The results of the workshop are grouped into 3 to 5 impacts. For example, one or two on the use aspect, one on the social aspect, one on the ecological aspect.

Each objective is associated with one or more key impacts.

They are placed on the canvas.

## Consolidation of the charter (15')

Review of the 3 parts. Checking consistency. Improvement.

Participants can go and see what the other groups have done.
